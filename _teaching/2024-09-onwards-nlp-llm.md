This course introduces Natural Language Processing (NLP) using large language models (LLMs), with a focus on biomedical and scientific texts. Students explore transformers, tokenization, embeddings, and fine-tuning of pre-trained models like BERT and GPT.

Key Topics
==========

- NLP fundamentals and biomedical language corpora  
- Transformer architectures (BERT, GPT)  
- Prompt engineering and fine-tuning for domain-specific tasks

Outcomes
========

Students learn to build, fine-tune, and evaluate LLMs for biomedical applications such as summarization, entity recognition, and knowledge extraction.
